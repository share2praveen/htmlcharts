# htmlcharts
Simple responsive HTML charts using HTML, CSS and JS

1. Gender based
2. Correlation stacked bar
3. Single Line
4. Correlation circular
5. Correlation blocks

Long before created these charts and stayed unused for a long time.  Inspired by D3.js examples and designed along with my Senior.  I have tried these graphs in vanilla Javascript.

ToDos:
<ul>
<li>Show the JSON explicitly</li>
<li>Setup config properties to add dimensions/colors to the charts</li>
<li>Showcase the charts</li>
</ul>
